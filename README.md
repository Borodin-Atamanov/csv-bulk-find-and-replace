Bulk find and replace in CSV files

Â© Copyright 2021 Slava Borodin-Atamanov

The program reads all cells from the "input.csv", searches for a line from the first column from the "findreplace.csv", replaces it with a string from the second column of the "findreplace.csv" file.

Run the program
`python csv-bulk-find-and-replace.py`

The input.csv and findreplace.csv examples will be created

Put your source text to input.csv

Save the "what-to-find", "what to replace" pairs to the "findreplace.csv"
In the first column - what-to-find, in the second column what-to-replace.

The program will create a configuration in the config.ini file in the "output-csv-bulk-find-and-replace" directory
